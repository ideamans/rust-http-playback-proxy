# Cargo configuration for http-playback-proxy

[build]
# Integration tests should run single-threaded to avoid port conflicts
# and timing issues between parallel test executions

[test]
# NOTE: This setting is not standard cargo config
# Use `cargo test -- --test-threads=1` explicitly for integration tests
# or set RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 environment variable
